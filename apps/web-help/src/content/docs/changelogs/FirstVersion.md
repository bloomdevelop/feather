## What's new

:::tip[Alpha Version]
This version is unstable and it's not complete, even some features are not implemented yet. So make sure to suggest or report bugs in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bloomdevelop/feather/issues).
:::

- This is the first release of Feather client but, also the initial work in a new monorepo.
- Feather uses `solid-ui` for UI/UX while using Solid.js for framework.
- Compact mode has been added but it's not complete yet.
- Developer mode has been added, useful for debugging and making new components. Not intended for production.
- Currently we're making an own client library for [Revolt.chat](https://revolt.chat), that's mean we will use the same API as `revolt.js` but with some extra features, even with `X-Session-Token` header (needed for some api functions).

## Features

- Light and Dark mode.
- Ability to switch between servers.
- Able to login with [your revolt.chat](https://revolt.chat) account
